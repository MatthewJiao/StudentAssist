# StudentAssist
A new way of reporting marks to students. Instead of the mark reporting systems being geared towards teachers and their benefit, StudentAssist aims to benefit students. This is done through interactive visuals of their marks, goals they can clearly set for themselves, and calculations that would help them attain their required marks.
